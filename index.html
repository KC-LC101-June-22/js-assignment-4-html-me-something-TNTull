               I was born in Portsmouth, Virginia.  My dad was in the US Navy so I was born in the Naval hospital.  We moved when I was 6 months old so I don't remember anything but I have visited Virginia as an adult.

              Mom moved to Imperial Beach, California (near Naval Base San Diego).  She liked the weather there.  She made several friends with other Navy wives. I remember a few things from there.  One memory was when I was 2.  I was playing with the 2 neighbor girls.  We climbed a fence and looked down.  We started screaming because there was a large gilla monster.  When I mentioned it years later, Mom could not believe I could remember it but some older neighbor boys had killed it.  Gilla monsters are large red and black poisonous lizards. They are dangerous.

               We moved to Newark, Ohio when I was 5.  We lived in a 2 story house with a round room at the corner of the living room.  Like a castle turrent.  I went to Kindergarden.  My maternal Grandma had cancer for several years. She was dying and she stayed with us in the round room.  She was 44 when she died. Dad had been honorably discharged from the Navy when we lived in Newark.

               My parents bought a house in Pataskala, Ohio.  I turned 6 and my baby brother was born.  My paternal Grandma moved into a trailer down the hill from our house on the same street.  We loved it because we could visit her when she was off work.  It was a very steep hill and the road dead-ended at a creek.  The neighborhood loved sledding down it in the winter and it was a daily gathering place when it snowed.

               We moved to Kimberlin Heights, Tennessee. My dad wanted to become a minister so we lived in a trailer on the campus of Johnson Bible College (it is now Johnson University).  We helped build many building that are still in use today but the roads have been changed so it all looks very different.  When we lived there, we were in the oldest of 3 trailer courts.  Now it doesn't exist.  We lived there 5 years.  I had turned 9 (started the 4th grade) and we left when I was about to turn 14 (finished the 8th grade.)

               We made wonderful friends and loved being near the Smokies! I have visited the college a few times as an adult.  I have been back to the Smokies so many times.  I love hiking in the Smokies with family, friends, later with a husband, and my children.

               I include Tasso, Tennessee and Broadhead, Kentucky as a place where we also lived during this time.  When you are nearing the end of your studies for the ministry, you are to be a part-time minister for  churches.  Usually, these churches are very small and in small towns.  They can't afford a full-time minister so they hire the students and pay for their gas to get there on Friday and get back to the college on Sunday night. We did that every weekend for the last 2 years.  The parsonages (the house the church provides for the minister) were small but was okay for a weekend. The people were nice.  The one in Broadhead was next door to a funeral home which was okay.

               We moved to Statesboro, Georgia and then I turned 14.  This house had been empty for several years. I liked living in Statesboro.  It has so many things for the youth to do in the summer!  I had never experienced a city that did that!  The neighbors were great and our yard was the gathering place for the kids on the whole block.  We had such fun.  We had backyard olympic games and so much more.  They were a great group of kids.  I also had my first date there and we dated all summer.  The school system was crazy, though.  They had several grade schools, one  middle school for 7th and 8th grade, one junior high school for 9th grade, and one high school for 10th through 12th.  Some of the grade school kids had to change buses 2 or 3 times.  The Kindergarden kids had the worst time of changing buses.  We older kids had to stay on the bus but we watched to make sure the younger ones got in their correct lines.

               We moved to Bainbridge, Georgia before the end of the school year.  This house was very nice.  The neighbors were very nice. The neighbor kids were nice and we had fun playing kickball and other games. One of the ladies in the church took care of Jimmy Carter's house and businesses while he was President and while he lived in the White House.

               We moved to Griffin, Indiana. We were half through the first semester of school. I was in the 11th grade and was was 16 years old.  My senior year I had all my credits to graduate except 2 so I took 2 classes my first semester and graduated early.

               The town claimed they had 200 residents but I think they had not updated it in awhile.  I counted and there was not 200 people.  The town had a short main street and 2 alleys.  Most of the people were nice.  There were 5 elderly ladies that were excited that I graduated early.  They had me drive them to lots of nearby towns for shopping and eating out.  We had so much fun.  We would get together after Wednesday night church to play Uno.  I kept writing to these ladies for years afterwards.  Most of them were in their 80s and 90s when I was 17.

               We moved to a little larger town across the state line, Grayville, Illionis. I was 17 and turned 18.  I tried to get a job with IBM but the HR man said it was not for women.  I worked at a grocery store for a year after I graduated.  The owner of the grocery store was nice and our families became friends for years.

               I turned 19 and moved to a college dorm in Artesia, New Mexico.  There I majored in Bible and Art.  I took 23 to 25 credit hours a semester and loved it.  I made 4.0 in most of my classes but in 2 classes I made a 3.8 and 3.6.  I was on traveling singing groups and one semester was on a traveling muppet team.  I liked living there.

               I came back to Excelsior Springs for the summer and got a job at World's of Fun.  I saved my money.  My brother graduated high school and went into the Navy.  He had medical problems so they gave him an honorable discharge.

               I moved back to college in Artesia.  I finished my junior year and earned a scholarship for my senior year.  The college was having problems and many of the professors left.  I had to stop attending.  That was sad.  I got a job at a grocery store and rented an apartment with a roommate.  I wanted to stay in that city because I liked it.

               I had to move because my roommate returned to her parents' house in Colorado and I could not afford the rent alone.  I moved into a small house and loved it.  I lived there a year before a recession hit and most of us lost our jobs and many businesses closed. My brother was still working as a fireman and on the ambulance.

               I had to have a job so I went back to Excelsior Springs because there were jobs available.  My youngest brother got married. I worked at a factory for a year.  It lost most of its contracts and we were all laid off.  My parents had moved to Kansas City so I rented a room from them. Kansas City has the most fountains in the US and second to Rome in the world.

               My parents got a divorce so Mom and I moved into a pretty apartment on the first floor.  It had a winding swimming pool outside our sliding glass doors.  We liked it.  Mom had to move to Dallas to help my brother and sister-in-law in their office.  They had both become doctors.

I liked this apartment.  My boyfriend moved into the apartment across the basement.  I liked my neighbors in the building.  I lived there a year then wanted to buy a house.

               The yard was 3 acres. It was pretty and a lot of yard work.  My kids helped and they loved playing in the small barn. Mom lost her job and could not find another one so I paid her bills. I lost my job and I could not find another one. I used my retirement money. I had Mom move in with me.

               My retirement money ran out after 3 years. Mom and I were finally able to find a seasonal job. Mom stayed with the kids while I worked at night and she went to work in the morning when I got home.  When my retirement money ran out, I lost both houses.  I was devastated but had to keep strong for my kids and Mom.

               I found a job and Mom did, too.  It was too late to save my houses so in December, we moved into a small house in Independence, Missouri (actually in Sugar Creek).  Mom stayed with us to help me with the kids.  We have lived here for 16 years.  I don't like renting that long and not owning the house but it could not be helped.

               I have always tried to travel as much as possible. I love meeting people and traveled all over the US by myself, with family, then with my husband, and later with my kids.  I have been to all the states except 6. I have also been to Mexico many times, the Grand Bahama Island once, and Ecuador once.

               As a Mom, I have taken my kids all over the US as well. We went to Disneyworld in Florida, many other amusement parks, many zoos, hiking in the Rockies, hiking in the Smokies, played in the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean, played on many sand dunes, visited Mt Rushmoe, Crazy Horse, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, canoeing on small rivers, and so much more.  We have gone to most festivals in this area and traveled to some farther away.  I always tried to fill their memory banks with as many fun memories as possible.
